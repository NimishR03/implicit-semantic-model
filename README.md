# Semantic Communication Framework Using Implicit Reasoning Mechanism 

## Overview
The iSAC framework employs a graph-inspired structure to represent semantics and utilizes a generative adversarial imitation learning-based algorithm, G-RML, to infer implicit reasoning paths. This approach significantly enhances communication efficiency and semantic interpretation accuracy.

### Key Contributions:
- **Graph-inspired Semantic Representation**: Captures both explicit and implicit meanings.
- **Projection-based Encoding**: Efficiently transmits semantic data through low-dimensional spaces.
- **Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (G-RML)**: Trains reasoning mechanisms to infer implicit semantics.

## Features
- Supports reasoning-based communication for complex semantic interactions.
- Efficient encoding and decoding of semantic data.
- Robust to noise and channel variations.
- Includes training and testing scripts for evaluation.
